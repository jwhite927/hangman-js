# hangman-js

## Introduction
hangman-js is a simple implementation of a hangman game in javascript.

The concept is that in the beginning of the game, Player 1 enters a word into the alert window.
Player 2 does not know the word. Player 2 must guess letters to complete the word.
If Player 2 guesses a letter that is not in the word, that letter is added to the guessed letters list
and part of the hangman is drawn in. If Player 2 guesses a letter that IS in the word, that letter is filled in in the puzzle.

## To Run the Game
